___Summary___

I created an App that populates the 'grid' with instagram photos using the Instagram API. It displays the image results, username, likes and comments for a more user-friendly experience. Ultimately the goal here was to learn how to use Ajax to retrieve JSON photo objects and enhancing the UI with Javascript and jQuery.

___Tools Used___

HTML5/CSS
SASS
Flexbox
Ajax requests
JSON object rendering and reading
Javascript
jQuery
Gulp -- efficient file organization, file minification, browser sync, SASS processing
Git and GitHub

___Challenges___

The most challenging and valuable lesson I learned was how to use Gulp and understanding the nature of Flex-box which adds new dimesions to the project. The 'load more' function gives a nice feel to the app and gives the user more control.
