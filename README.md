Summary

I created an App that populates the 'grid' with instagram photos using the Instagram API. It displays the image results, username, likes and comments for a more user-friendly experience. Ultimately the goal was to learn how to use Ajax to retrieve JSON photo objects and uplifting the UI with Javascript and jQuery.

Tools Used

HTML5/CSS
SASS
Flexbox
Ajax requests
JSON object rendering and reading
Javascript
jQuery
Gulp -- efficient file organization, file minification, browser sync, SASS processing
Git and GitHub

The most challenging, yet most valuable piece I learned was how to use Gulp and Flex-box to add new dimesions to the project.
